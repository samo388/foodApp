# Application Overview – FoodApp

## 1. General Description
FoodApp is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-world food ordering platform.
The project is used as a base application to demonstrate a complete, production-ready DevOps
workflow including containerization, CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and security.

The application follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation between frontend,
backend, and database layers.

## 2. Architecture Overview

Frontend (Client)
? communicates with Backend via REST API  
Backend (API Server)
? handles business logic, authentication, and data processing  
Database
? stores application data (users, products, orders)

Target Architecture:
- Cloud-native
- Containerized
- Scalable
- Highly available

---

## 3. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Framework: React
- Build Tool: Vite
- Communication: REST API (HTTP/JSON)
- Port: 5173 (local development)

### Backend
- Runtime: Node.js
- Framework: Express.js
- API Style: RESTful APIs
- Authentication: JWT
- Port: 5000 (default)

### Database
- Type: Relational Database
- Engine: PostgreSQL
- Accessed only by backend service
- Not exposed publicly

---

## 4. Environment Variables

### Backend Required Environment Variables
- PORT: Backend service port
- DB_HOST: Database host
- DB_USER: Database username
- DB_PASSWORD: Database password
- DB_NAME: Database name
- JWT_SECRET: Secret key for authentication tokens

Environment variables are injected at runtime and never hardcoded in the source code.

---

## 5. Deployment Strategy (Target)

### Local Development
- Docker Compose
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, and database

### Production
- Docker images built via CI/CD pipeline
- Deployed on Kubernetes (EKS)
- Infrastructure provisioned using Terraform
- Secrets managed using a secure secrets manager
- Traffic exposed via Load Balancer / Ingress

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: Horizontal scaling using Kubernetes HPA
- Availability: Multi-node Kubernetes cluster
- Security:
  - No secrets in code
  - Least privilege access
  - Image vulnerability scanning
- Observability:
  - Metrics via Prometheus
  - Dashboards via Grafana
  - Centralized logging

---

## 7. DevOps Purpose of the Project

This project is intentionally used as a DevOps transformation case to demonstrate:
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Infrastructure as Code best practices
- Cloud-native deployment patterns
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Disaster recovery and rollback strategies

The goal is not the application features themselves, but the robustness and reliability
of the platform running the application.
